# P2P Lending Smart Contract for Small Businesses

## Introduction
This project implements a decentralized peer-to-peer lending platform specifically designed for small businesses on the Aptos blockchain. The smart contract facilitates direct lending relationships between lenders and small business borrowers, eliminating traditional intermediaries and making the lending process more efficient and accessible.

The contract provides two core functionalities:
1. Loan Request Creation - Small businesses can create loan requests specifying their desired amount
2. Loan Funding - Lenders can fund loan requests partially or fully

## Vision
The vision of this P2P lending platform is to democratize access to business financing by:
- Reducing barriers to entry for small business funding
- Creating a transparent and efficient lending marketplace
- Enabling fractional lending to distribute risk
- Eliminating unnecessary intermediaries and reducing costs
- Providing faster access to capital for small businesses
- Building a community-driven lending ecosystem
